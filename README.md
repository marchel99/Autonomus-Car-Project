# Overview 

This project is a group project for my master studies, where we aim to create a small autonomous car using an ESP32 microcontroller. The car will be able to navigate a predefined path, avoid obstacles, and follow traffic rules using sensors and algorithms (SLAM)

<h2> <b> Primary goal  </b> </h2>
The primary goal was to design and build an autonomous robot capable of detecting and following a track differentiated by materials â€” aluminum tape for the path and magnetic tape for the start and finish lines. The robot needed to successfully navigate from start to finish, avoiding any obstacles along the way.       

<h2><b> Track Design: </b></h2>
The track was a simple rectangle, with the long stretches marked by white aluminum tape and the shorter start and finish lines marked by red magnetic tape. This design tested the robot's ability to switch from following one type of tape to another without veering off course.

On the photo, we see the front view of a robot car that I've personally designed and 3D printed. The prominent grille at the front isn't just for aesthetics; it plays a functional role too. It conceals an infrared reflective sensor used for navigation. The track this car follows is laid out with magnetic tape at the start and finish lines, with aluminum tape forming the rest of the route. The car's sensor, mounted behind the grille, can be adjusted up or down to optimize its tracking performance, ensuring it can accurately follow the course from start to finish.
