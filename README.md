# Overview 

This project is a group project for my master studies, where we aim to create a small autonomous car using an ESP32 microcontroller. The car will be able to navigate a predefined path, avoid obstacles using sensors and algorithms (SLAM)

On the left side, there is a representation of a path that our academic instructors set up for us, delineated with aluminum tape for the boundaries and highlighted by red lines in the image to represent the magnetic tape for the start and finish lines. Our main aim, both straightforward and challenging, was to construct an autonomous car capable of navigating from 'START' to 'FINISH.' This required the car to: <br>
<br>
1.Spot the finish line, which is indicated by the magnetic tape. <br><br>
2.Stay within the track marked by the aluminum tape. <br><br>
3.Avoid any blocks or objects it comes across on the track. <br><br>

# Front view
In the image provided, we can observe the frontal perspective of my autonomous vehicle prototype, meticulously crafted and fabricated through 3D printing techniques. Notably, the grille showcased at the forefront serves more than just a decorative purpose; it fulfills a pivotal functional role. Concealed within this grille lies an infrared reflective sensor meticulously engineered for navigation purposes..

The way I've set it up is future-proof, meaning if we ever need to attach a different sensor down the line, we can easily do it. Also, we can adjust the sensor's position up or down to get the best performance.

# Back view
Looking at the back, I took a similar approach. Here, you'll also find a reflective sensor, which can be adjusted up or down. By placing sensors both at the front and back, we ensure that the car never veers beyond the aluminum line. This dual-sensor setup guarantees precise navigation along the designated path.

# Overview
This image showcases the comprehensive layout of our autonomous vehicle project. Central to the design is a robust chassis, carrying a green printed circuit board (PCB) prominently placed for electronic components. Encoders, which precisely measure the wheel speed, are positioned on the black side elements. Additionally, accommodations have been made for a stepper motor; this key component features a lever for zeroing as well as an integrated limit switch for precise control. At the forefront, there's a designated spot for a laser sensor, engineered for the crucial task of obstacle detection, ensuring smooth navigation.
